                            <p>
                                This project is a tool to browse my favorite online recipes more visually, showing previews of each recipe (an image and
                                a link to the recipe website) in containers on a webpage built with HTML and CSS. I added styling to enhance visual appeal, 
                                then used Box Model and Flexbox concepts to organize the recipe containers in a way that would feel nice to browse.

                            <p>
                                This project progressed my HTML skills with an emphasis on using semantic HTML elements to improve readability and accessiblity, 
                                involving changing non-semantic HTML tags to semantic ones. 
                                It also familiarized me with more HTML and CSS elements and practices, including the use of an external styling sheet, as well as how to fork
                                an existing GitHub repository from another profile.
                            </p>

                        <li><a href="https://github.com/cramerjillian/about-me">About Me</a>
                            <p>
                                This project involved creating a short "About Me" webpage, progressing my HTML skills by incorporating fundamental elements and some CSS styling.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="https://github.com/cramerjillian/hello-html">Hello HTML</a>
                            <p>
                                This project served as an introduction to both writing HTML in VS Code and using Git/GitHub for version control by simply displaying the text
                                "Hello HTML!" in a webpage.
                                This involved creating the HTML boilerplate and using Git terminal commands to push the contents of a local repository to GitHub.
